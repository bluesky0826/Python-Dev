What's new in 8.3.1
-------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 5507fdbf623f](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/5507fdbf623f);
relevant code changes:

 - Making `national_significant_number` more robust in the face of malicious
   input. This now ignores the `number_of_leading_zeros` if they are less than
   zero.


What's new in 8.3.0
-------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit ad297a10ba19](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/ad297a10ba19);
relevant code changes:

 - Added two new enum values to `ValidationResult` - `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` and
   `INVALID_LENGTH`. Added more documentation to the existing values; see the
   docstrings for when these are going to be used. Note that the API for
   `is_possible_number_with_reason` has not yet been changed to return these values.
   `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` will be returned for some values which currently
   return `IS_POSSIBLE`, and `INVALID_LENGTH` will be returned for some values which
   currently return `TOO_LONG`.
 - Fix for `is_number_match` to ignore the `number_of_leading_zeros` field when comparing
   numbers unless `italian_leading_zero` is `True`, and to consider default values
   to match the same value when explicitly set for these two fields. This fix
   shouldn't be needed for anyone correctly creating phone numbers using "parse"
   as recommended.


What's new in 8.2.0
-------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 3b16d6b06497](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/3b16d6b06497);
relevant code changes:

 - Exported `normalize_diallable_chars_only`. This method is already public in the C++
   implementation. It has also now been added to the Javascript implementation.


What's new in 8.1.0
-------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit c210dbca4e93](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/c210dbca4e93);
relevant code changes:

  - Introduced new `is_carrier_specific_for_region` API in `shortnumberinfo`.
    This determines whether the provided short code is carrier-specific or
    not when dialed from the given region.



What's new in 8.0.0
-------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 1eb06f31e1dd](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/1eb06f31e1dd);
relevant code changes:

  - Removing the ability for `.._for_region` methods in `shortnumberinfo.py` to work
    on strings, as well of phone number objects. These have been marked deprecated
    for months. Any users of these methods should call `phonenumbers.parse` first to
    create a `PhoneNumber` object, and pass this in.
  - Support semicolon as extension character while parsing phone numbers. This
    is not applicable when you are trying to find the phone numbers.



What's new in 7.7.5
-------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit e905483f87cf](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/e905483f87cf);
relevant code changes:

  - Removing all references to `possible_number_pattern` other than in the metadata
    itself.



What's new in 7.7.4
-------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit fedbc7020703](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/fedbc7020703);
code changes:

 - GitHub project changes:
    - Changed tag to `vX.Y.Z` from `release-X.Y.Z`; this may affect ports and derived projects.
 - Metadata structure changes in XML file:
    - Mobile and Fixed-Line blocks are no longer assumed to inherit missing data
      from the GeneralDesc, but are treated like every other phone number type.
      This means that for the non-geographical country codes, like +800, the
      example number has been moved from generalDesc to the relevant number types,
      and the code in getExampleNumberForNonGeoEntity has been changed to look at
      these sub-types for an example number.
      This also means that the "NA" and "-1" blocks present in the metadata to
      indicate that no mobile or fixed-line numbers appear for the entity have been
      removed.
      There should no longer be an `exampleNumber` at the `generalDesc` level, but it
      should be present at every `PhoneNumberDesc` with data.
 - Code changes:
    - Using new `possibleLengthInfo` to decide whether a short number is the right
      length or not. This could result in more specific results; whereas before, a
      number from length 3 to length 6 may have been deemed possible, now we may
      exclude a number of length 5.
    - Add hash (#) as a diallable character. Numbers with # in them will no longer
      have formatting applied in `format_n_original_format`, and
      `normalize_diallable_chars_only` now retains the # symbol.
    - `example_number_for_non_geo_entity` has been changed to look at the specific
      number types, not just the generalDesc, for the example numbers; this is a
      necessary change after the metadata structure change detailed above.



What's new in 7.7.3
-------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit ad0ce0c94501](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/ad0ce0c94501);
code changes:

 - Fixed `phonemetadata.py` not to merge from a `NumberFormat`'s unset bool
   `national_prefix_optional_when_formatting`.


What's new in 7.7.2
-------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 2d0d216f6032](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/2d0d216f6032);
code changes:

 - Stop setting empty `preferred_domestic_carrier_code`, and if we are passed such
   a number then treat the empty field as if unset.


What's new in 7.7.1
-------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 8c37310deb49](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/8c37310deb49);
code changes:

 - Switching the internal implementation of `is_possible_number` and related functions
   to use the new `possibleLengths` metadata. This affects a lot of countries,
   making `is_possible_number` more restrictive as more precise data is available. It
   also affects parsing ambiguous and invalid numbers, as we decide whether
   to strip a possible national prefix (1) or country code based on the length
   of the number and whether it is possible before or after this.
 - Formatting, naming and comment tweaks to follow style guide
 - Removal of unneeded `_can_be_geocoded` method in the
   `timezone.py` file, using `phonenumberutil.py` instead


What's new in 7.7.0
-------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 1ec4d341c3cd](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/1ec4d341c3cd);
no code changes that affect the Python version so this is just a version bump to
stay in sync with upstream.


What's new in 7.6.1
-------------------

Merge to [upstream commit 7cc500f588db](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/7cc500f588db); code changes:

 - `phonemetadata.py` has two more fields to represent possible lengths of phone
   numbers. Changed `buildmetadatafromxml.py` to alter the way
   that metadata about possible-lengths information is consumed when constructing
   metadata to populate these.

What's new in 7.6.0
-------------------

Merge to [upstream commit ddf60b1c175e](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/ddf60b1c175e); code changes:

 - Made `is_number_geographical()` public and added `is_number_type_geographical()`,
   and changed the geocoder to use this when checking whether to give a detailed
   answer or country-level only.


What's new in 7.5.0
-------------------

Merge to [upstream commit 3f83454ed62b](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/3f83454ed62b); no code changes that affect the Python
version so this is just a version bump to stay in sync with upstream.

-------------------

Merge to [upstream commit 598b9a4f89d6](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/598b9a4f89d6); no code changes that affect the Python
version so this is just a version bump to stay in sync with upstream.


What's new in 7.3.0
-------------------

Merge to [upstream commit d933631fbf15](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/d933631fbf15); code changes:

 - Added support for `region_code of None in example_number_for_type()`
 - Added `invalid_example_number()`
 - Improvements to docstring for parse method
 - Update `is_number_geographical` to return true for geographical mobile numbers.


What's new in 7.2.0
-------------------

Merge to [upstream commit ab5e61acc087ec9f5](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/ab5e61acc087ec9f5), which is 7.2.1 (7.2.0 had an immediate
problem on release); upstream changelog mentions no code changes, but the Java
implementation includes a change to use nano protobufs.


What's new in 7.1.0
-------------------

Merge to [upstream commit 903ac5de5b6e1112](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/903ac5de5b6e1112); upstream code changelog:

 - Only upstream code change doesn't affect python version
   (New `MetadataSource` implementation that reads from a single metadata file with
   all regions' phone number metadata.)


What's new in 7.0.0
-------------------

Merge to upstream Subversion revision 715; upstream code changelog:

 - New APIs for ShortNumberInfo. The old APIs have been deprecated and will be
   removed in an upcoming release.


What's new in 6.3.0
-------------------

Merge to upstream Subversion revision 703; upstream code changelog:

 - Changing the offline geocoder to not return any country at all if the number
   could belong to multiple countries
 - Removing obsolete code that treated countries with no metadata as valid.


What's new in 6.2.0
-------------------

Merge to upstream Subversion revision 674; upstream code changelog:

 - Better exclusion of dates when matching phone numbers from text.
 - Handle phone input in RFC3966 with missing tel: prefix


What's new in 6.1.0
-------------------

Merge to upstream Subversion revision 656; upstream code changelog:

 - Adding MetadataLoader support to allow custom metadata loading from
   alternative sources (should have no visible impact to users).
 - Fixing bug where digits could be lost in as-you-type formatting and
   formatting patterns incorrectly applied.


What's new in 6.0.0a
--------------------

Split geographic metadata into chunks.
Generate separate `phonenumbers-lite` package.
(No upstream changes.)


What's new in 6.0.0
-------------------

Removed beta status.
Merge up to upstream Subversion revision 650; upstream code changelog:

 - Better support for detecting phone numbers in text that are beside each
   other
 - Change to how Japanese numbers beginning with "00" are modelled, with the
   side-effect that the maximum possible number length has been extended by
   1.
 - Handle `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` in the `AsYouTypeFormatter` when the
   national prefix that was extracted was not found in the prefix. This
   affected countries with very long carrier codes, such as Korea.
 - Removal of some of the author attributions - contributions to be tracked
   in CONTRIBUTORS file.


What's new in 5.9b1
-------------------

The codebase now supports Python 2.5-2.7 and Python 3.x out of the box, without
needing 2to3 conversion.

The top-level module no longer exports the following functions:

 - `country_name_for_number`
 - `description_for_number`
 - `description_for_valid_number`

These functions now need to be imported via the `phonenumbers.geocoder` submodule.

The short number functions have been renamed:

 - `is_possible_short_number_object` becomes `is_possible_short_number`
 - `is_possible_short_number` becomes `is_possible_short_number_for_object`
 - `is_valid_short_number_object` becomes `is_valid_short_number`
 - `is_valid_short_number` becomes `is_valid_short_number_for_object`
 - `expected_cost` becomes `expected_cost_for_region`, and there's a new `expected_cost`
   function that takes a `PhoneNumber` object.

Merge up to upstream Subversion revision 622; upstream code changelog:

  - Adding support for numbers with multiple Italian leading zeros, by
    adding a field to the phone number proto to allow an arbitrary number of
    leading zeros, and supporting this when parsing, validating and
    formatting.
  - Adding more functionality to `ShortNumberInfo` -> such as
    `GetExpectedCostForRegion`.
  - Fix for parsing short numbers that start with the national prefix.
  - Updating `FormatNumberForMobileDialing` to work with short numbers.
  - Stop finding Israeli 4-digit "star" numbers in text when no star is in
    fact present.
  - Bug fix for finding phone numbers where the area code was also part of
    the country calling code.


What's new in 5.8b1
-------------------

Rename `shortnumberutil.py` to `shortnumberinfo.py`.
Merge up to upstream Subversion revision 603; upstream code changelog:

 - Renamed `ShortNumberUtil` to `ShortNumberInfo` -> the former class is now
   deprecated and will be deleted in a later release. At the moment it just
   delegates to `ShortNumberInfo`.
 - New methods in the `ShortNumberInfo` API - `isCarrierSpecific`, singleton interface,
   `isPossibleShortNumber`, `isValidShortNumber`, `getShortNumberCost`. Note this
   is an experimental API at the moment and subject to change.
 - Bug fixes:
    - AsYouTypeFormatting: 3-digit numbers can be formatted as a group
      where appropriate
    - AsYouTypeFormatting: Countries with an optional national prefix were
      considered before to have always entered it, resulting in bugs where
      numbers without the national prefix were not properly formatted.
    - Numbers in Chile that overlap with emergency numbers are no longer
      marked as connecting to them
    - Not requiring the NDC to be alone for countries where there is no
      national prefix in strict grouping when extracting phone numbers

What's new in 5.4b1
-------------------

Load metadata on demand rather than all at start of day.
